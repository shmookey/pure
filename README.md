PUsh RElay for Github repositories.

## Compiling from source

*pure* uses [stack](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to
simplify the build process. Once you have stack installed, simply run:

`stack build`

If you are running stack for the first time, you may need to install a
compatible Haskell toolchain first. Fortunately, stack makes this easy:

`stack setup`

Be sure to run this from inside the checked-out repository to ensure you
get the right version.
